- Hello Michael, thank you for allowing me today to run the demo and explain the features to Productos Ramos, I believe that at the current state of the software and modules, selling to Latinamerican clients will be a hard sell. This is why I wanted to negotiate/propose if I could use my years of experience as a Software Engineer to help in the better localization of your software in a technical manner. Here are some of the problems that I detected while preparing and demoing that I can help fixing using my background:

Problems:
1. Connection Problems
	1. Login  + Loading lag: Took me around 2 minutes to login, which is unacceptable for modern technologies
	2. Slow Upload / Posting Speed: Took me around 1-2 minutes to upload and post updates which is unacceptable for modern standards
2. Recommendation features 
	1. from what I had seen in the demo) is not accurate and requires too much company specific transaction data (history) to operate 
	2. The recommendation algorithm could be enhanced with more layers of research (In my opinion)
3.  AI Chat and Reporting , 
	1. The AI for a strange reason seems to randomnly toggle between Chinese/English/Spanish
	2. I believe that the reporting look can be improved, I can add LATAM specific features
4. Offline Features: 
	1. Many customers have to cover locations without Internet, (more in Latam) The current application doesn't support that 

How can I help:
1. Connection Problems: At the current moment it has  very slow loading speed (>1 mins per action), I can ensure better experience by creating server mirrors in closer regions, I am expecting responses in the orders of 100ms
2. Recommendation Features: My final thesis in the university was about optimizations for recommendation algorithms, this is a topic that I am very interested about developing more, I believe I can use all this experience to improve and research better algorithms that could work even in an offline setting and enhance the algorithm by overlying it with additional data outside of transactions
3. AI Chat and reporting: I can develop tests kits to ensure the proper translation of the languages and communicate with chinese engineers + Local clients to create better recommendations
4. Offline Features: I have experience developing offline software, currently the app won't work unless it is all times connected, I can help you publish local versions of the apps to support offline features
