- The idea is to maximize each job to get better and deeper than basics in each framework or technology being used.
- For example:
	- Imagine if you were to become automatically legendarily better at:
		- Elasticsearch
		- Python - Fluent
		- Advanced AWS
		- Postgresql.
		- Regex
	- How?
		- Reading the docs
			- Use this guide to even get better at those docs.
		- Consulting Advanced Books. -> Go over simple optimizations
		- Ensuring Quality of the project
			- Iterating on the documentation aim to implement one advanced query per day as per optimizations, or read up the docs on the topic
		- Ignoring other shiny frameworks
		- Reading and performing Best Practices
	- Why more important than previous approach?
		- No need of hiding anything, can proudly display what you are doing and recording as well what you are doing.
