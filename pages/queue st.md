- TODO What different variations mean Statistically significant:
	- You discover that A is positively correlated with variable B, and the effect is statistically
	  significant. You can conclude that A caused the change in B.
- TODO Understand what K clustering and similar algorithms does
	- If you perform k-means clustering on a dataset containing different types of tea, the clustering can
	  help you classify new teas you have never seen before
- TODO How to clean data, and the data expected by each function
	- Grouping and aggregating is a good way to smooth noisy data for visualization
- TODO All about p testing etc
	- In statistical tests, a large p-value is justification for rejecting the null hypothesis
- TODO Get some df loc apractice
- k-Nearest-Neighbors and k-Means Clustering
	- • Classification and regression as machine learning tasks
	- • Types of machine learning: supervised vs. unsupervised
	- • The k-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm
	- • Evaluating k-Nearest-Neighbors classification with test/validation sets and accuracy
	- • k-Means Clustering algorithm, finding a good value of k
	- • Analyzing and interpreting clusters
	- • Data normalization
	- • Encoding categorical variables
- Visualization
	- • Basic differences in functionality between Matplotlib and Seaborn
	- • The Matplotlib global state machine
	- • Subplots
- Principal component analysis
	- • What it is for and basic mechanics of how it works
	- • Interpretability of principal components
- Statistics and Hypothesis Testing
	- • What statistical tests are for and discussing what does the results mean.
	- • Components of a statistical test: Your hypothesis, null/alternative hypothesis
	- • Errors: Type 1 and Type 2
	- • Coin flipping example
	- • p-value: What it is and how to interpret it
	- • Types of statistical tests:
		- ◦ Pearson r: What it tests, r value and p value, how to interpret
		- ◦ Linear regression: What it tests, slope and intercept, how to
		- interpret
		- ◦ T-test: What it tests, how to interpret
		- ◦ Chi-squared test: What it tests, how to interpret, contingency tables, expected vs. observed
		  frequency
- Hook:
	- Do go over slides presentations 15 mins to preprare
		- Explain by Video
		- Try to solve problem in video
		- Check fi missing from outline
	- Prepare by modifying
	- Create exercises to compute visualizationas above
