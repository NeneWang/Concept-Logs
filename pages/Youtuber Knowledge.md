- The main area of your interests falls in:
	- |Area|Description + Strategy|Career Score|Popularity Score|
	  |--|--|--|--|
	  |Computer Science Topics|Algorithms, AI, Systems, Math, Deep CS Topics, Operative Systems, Recomenders, Leetcode Questions, System Design | Building upon, Leetcode questions, solving and packaging solutions and problems as Java, Javascript, C# libraries + Reading Books and explaining chapters and implementing algorithms to show how their work, and their intuitive approach. Read a small chapter in 25 minutes, and report a progress, then from that raw footage create tutorials. The quality doesn't have to be great, but is good to try to polish it and leave a section in your online resume with those tutorials and nice illustrations.|10|3|
	  |Software Engineering Tutorials|Teach Projects, in IOS, Arduino Etc. Literally grab the projects here: https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/videos and also from Challanges Week. As well as projects you have built for Hackathons. Polish them, and show how to build it.[:br][:br]This is important, to immortalize your knowledge, into videos, with well written codebase to also show off in your resume's blog. The quality doesn't have to be great, but is good to try to polish it and leave a section in your online resume with those tutorials and nice illustrations.[:br][:br]You can build series: By creating the same content and lessons (from advanced aspects, and encode them into youtube parts with cool graphics and titles that might impress recruiters ) You can copy from FreeCodeCamp, HackWeek, |9|3|
	  |Business and Game Study Cases|This is watching videos like GDC https://www.youtube.com/@Gdconf/videos[:br]Then replicating down the study cases, and explain and brief down what they are teaching (The key points that makes sense to you)[:br][:br]Play games:[:br]Analyze why they work and why they dont. Analyze music etc.[:br][:br]Watch Movies and narrative, explain why they work, and why they dont.[:br][:br]Analyze business that you work with, from a personal perspective: services such as Hostinger, AWS, Google, (from the point of view of your personal touch)[:br]I think trying to understand cases externally might be too tough. It would be more interesting, if you could, pick up a business and understand part by part how they work. By working in those areas. Such as Panda expressand internal aspects of their business[:br]|[:br][:br]6|6|
	  |Game Optimization Simulation|Play games that might be advantaged by some obscure CS Topic.[:br]Create simulations, explain your findings, write down a blog.[:br]|8|6|
