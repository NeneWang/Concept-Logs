- Whats the difference between Euler Cycle and Euyler path
	- Euler Path instead of starting and ending on the same vertex, allows ending on a different vertex.

- What is the Traveling Salesman Problem?
	- ### Definition
	  
	  The Traveling Salesman Problem involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city. Formally, given a list of ùëõ*n* cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the objective is to determine the shortest possible route that:
	- Starts at a specified city (the origin),
	- Visits each city exactly once,
	- Returns to the origin city.
