- Background Storytelling
  collapsed:: true
	- Also like no story telling. This can be seen in such as Mario etc. Where people come from the mechanics first.
	- Case Studies
	  collapsed:: true
		- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSz127Adpqs&ab_channel=SoberDwarf}}
		- Here the story telling takes in the background, not taking itself that seriously. The player can expect to ignore it and not taking
		- That's a story of beautiful Story Telling.

- General Tips:
  collapsed:: true
	- Better done without Online - Multiplayer. Multiplayer has to somehow link or just be for fun.
- Movie/Series Like Storytelling
- Story Building
  collapsed:: true
	- Games that does this:
		- Rimworld
		- Total War
		- Models and simulations that create their own stories.
- Patterns and Antipatterns on Multiplayer Games
  collapsed:: true
	- Better not have storytelling, or backgorund-like. Make it dumb Fumnmu. with some hidden Trailer and Backgrounds
	- 2 Player Coop are more friendly for stories.
		- It Takes Two
		- Soul
	- Otherwise CoOp Story Generators such as:
		- Zomboid
	- Anti Patterns:
		- Genshin Impact - Breaks the immersion having characters. Makes no sense to have that many cut scenes to be honest
		- Wow and Other MMORPGs such as Dragon Nest. (Breaks Immersion, is everyone on this epic journey? xdd)
		- Halo - Too much cutscenes.
			- In my opinion it should just treat you as a squad and have a squad member follow you even on single player.
	- Good Examples - You are not unique but a reemplazable employee like.
		- Lethal Company
		- Hell Divers
		- Counter Strike - Ready Or Not- Phantasmofobia
