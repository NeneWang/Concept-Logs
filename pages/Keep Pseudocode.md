- Keep an habit of maintaining Pseudocode on parallel to development. Having something like Obsidian makes sense when it comes to catching the pseudocode.
- Never mind, is quite friendly in that sense. But I still kind of prefer the obsidian way? Like it supports language specific pseudocode. and Imo everything that is written here has the intention of being used at eventually [[Content writing]].
