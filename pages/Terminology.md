- Snowpipe
	- Snowpipe enables loading data from files as soon as theyâ€™re available in a stage. This means you can load data from files in micro-batches, making it available to users within minutes, rather than manually executing COPY statements on a schedule to load larger batches.

		- Resolving Memory Spillage
			- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse-memory
			- Memory spillage occurs when a computer program (like a database query or data processing task) runs out of available memory (RAM) and has to use disk space to store some of the data temporarily. This usually happens because the amount of data being processed exceeds the memory capacity. Since disk storage is much slower than RAM, memory spillage can significantly slow down the performance of the program.
