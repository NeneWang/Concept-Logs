	- |Decision|Description|
	  |--|--|
	  |Key [[documentation]] using Trello Mainly as main Task Indexer|Also add Logseq for personal documentation but the Trello Board for organizing tasks.|
	  | God of Creation nice habit.|Is a nice nocturnal habit where you must be "Creating" daily.|
	  |Document 25-5s in Video.|Use the video recorder to record 25-5s|
	  |Use Logseq for Personal Documentation|Is about organizing documentaiton in a way you are happy to continue editing them.|
	  |Use Latex for Resumes.|Allows multiple edits.|
	  |Table Docs -> Notion| Where you want to have Priority Matrixes, Have more detail Screenshots of the products.|
	  |Sec Notes -> |In Notebook. They are awesome for long-term storage with fingerkeys.|
	  |Flashcarding Types|Less variate but Intensive and Quality: Or Language Heavy/ Writting short term Memo or Languages with Pictures Anki suggested.[:br][:br]Quick Concept: Such as classes, courses notes, reading summaries where you want to memorize notes use LogSeq. The flaschards here are low quality, dont stress over memorization, just quickly go over the cards, no stress in getting it right. Just reviewing the existence of the concepts is enough. use Brackets to represent when viewed as the card, what is the specific question[:br][:br]Long Term Environmentalization: Such as terminology in practice, that require writting and usage of examples MCLI Makes sense in this case. Definitions should be provided, just use them on the correct example.[:br]|
