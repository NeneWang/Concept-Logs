- ## Testing DDWin
- ### DDWin Testcase 1:
	- lets start writing on DDWin from 10:38 to 10:43
	- I should expect 1 long event of around 3 minutes
	- With multiple clicks and keyboard to have. an single event.
	- Result:
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1712846684734_0.png)
	- I should expect 1 event around every 1 minute starting from 38. Lets review what is being sent at each point.
		- Lets see: 778:
		  collapsed:: true

			- We see two logseqs

			- Here no logseq events were added.

			- The end date should be the current timestamp of the event being sent.
				- This should also be clarified on the documentation

		- Lets review how this is being processed at the end.

		- This wasn't on the documentation but the Logseq should also send the latest endtime available.

- ![image.png](../assets/image_1712850118563_0.png)
	- Is there a way to have it as such? Can he still have access even if is_enabled = False?
	- An alternate solution is to have the
- #### Handling Similar Like Events
	- Perhaps there is a duplication because switched between windows very quickly
	- Should this be handled as a new pipeline of events? e.g. a different enhancement strategy?
		- If we distinguish this as a new strategy, we can also add other analogous enhancements such as:
			-
- #### Handling a quick query for Active qualification vs not really Active
	- Create an `timeslot` field named `is_interactive`
	- Also how about the quality of the timeslot? given AI? should that be handled into a new
