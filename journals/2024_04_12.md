- ### Design Cards Based W.
- Instead of having the problems sets, on card have another deck for it.
- Testing Concepts
	- Instead of separating via topic (it might make sense via difficulty but nah.)
		- I like the idea that agents, either use CS, or Business.
		- Or Finance Concepts Quiz.
		- Or the first cards being populated are in between those areas in specific
	- Also different types of units have different rules of engagement
		- Ships: Can't decide to launch attacks. But react to events: attacks, production.
		- Infantry: Less rules can attack randomly
	- Rework in Economy:
		- Instead of paying units using coins. There are no coins. You choose problems (currency) and cards from the deck to pick.
		- Then you solve the problems (as ammunition in your own time.) As well as placing the cards into the field. (You can just think of it that adquiring x amount of tech) depends on the lucky draw of the economy.
		- Another idea of how economy work is by having different decks for mechanics? Or that you can pick what to choose depending on what infrastructure you have on your base?
			- So the idea is that depending on the level of infrastructure, you can draw from different decks as well.
			- Making sense for tech advancement. So just placing you
	- Rework Matching:
		- Pvp matching to make it fair, can limit what technologies are being used. Since technically on the official game someone has to review the equations
