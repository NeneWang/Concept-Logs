- ### Design Cards Based W.
- Instead of having the problems sets, on card have another deck for it.
- Testing Concepts
	- Instead of separating via topic (it might make sense via difficulty but nah.)
		- I like the idea that agents, either use CS, or Business.
		- Or Finance Concepts Quiz.
		- Or the first cards being populated are in between those areas in specific
	- Also different types of units have different rules of engagement
		- Ships: Can't decide to launch attacks. But react to events: attacks, production.
		- Infantry: Less rules can attack randomly
		- Aerospace: cant be attacked, unless specified in the card. (Since many aerial spaces cant target aero units)
			- Dont count as defense line. Only Infantry and Ships
			- Space: a subset. but they specialize in intelligence:
				- example: Attacking Attachments and Infrastructure. Instead
	- Rework in Economy:
		- Instead of paying units using coins. There are no coins. You choose problems (currency) and cards from the deck to pick.
		- Then you solve the problems (as ammunition in your own time.) As well as placing the cards into the field. (You can just think of it that adquiring x amount of tech) depends on the lucky draw of the economy.
		- Another idea of how economy work is by having different decks for mechanics? Or that you can pick what to choose depending on what infrastructure you have on your base?
			- So the idea is that depending on the level of infrastructure, you can draw from different decks as well.
			- Making sense for tech advancement. So just placing your hand in the economy means things
	- Rework Matching:
		- Pvp matching to make it fair, can limit what technologies are being used. Since technically on the official game someone has to review the equations
	- Example of Agencies
		- It can be agents and or agencies. I think the group makes more sense. Agencies work as attachments.
		- Each platform has an amount of attachments. For example. Base could have the most amount or depending on the level of it. Or perhaps they are not even. Like depending on the count of attachments, then the infrastructure is automatically upgraded.
		- Agencies can be used to quickly boost either infrastructure level, or troop qualities.
	- Idea of attachments as upgrades instead of tracking upgrades.
		- Some experience might mark their veterancy: By attaching Units on bottom. Depending on the unit. They might scale differently. e.g. Increasing Attack Dice Base Increase. Increasing Defense points. Allowing Special infantry Skills. Adding Guardian Angels. (e.g. Soviet mass army.) (Ideally none-increasing costs of the unit.)
		- Base scales with attachments.
		- Destroying enemy units usually leads to increased veterancy.
	- Base Colony usually has predefined rules.
		- e.g. quantity of cards drawn,  quantity of deployed units allowed. e.g. Passive effects like adding additional cards from X Deck.
		- e.g. Allowing
